## Vision Statement
FriendNudge is your personal assistant for maintaining and building lifelong friendships. Our app helps you keep track of when you last called your friends and nudges you when it's time to catch up again. Strengthen your connections effortlessly with FriendNudge.

## Motivation
In our busy lives, it’s easy to lose track of the last time we connected with our friends. We’re working on FriendNudge to make it easier to maintain those important relationships. Our goal is to help people stay connected and strengthen their social bonds.

## Risks to Project Completion
- **New language or working environment:** Some team members might be new to the technologies we are using.
- **No prior experience working with these team members:** This is our first project together, which may pose coordination challenges.
- **Lack of some needed resources:** We might face challenges with access to necessary development tools or environments.

### Mitigation Strategy
- **New language or working environment:** Schedule regular knowledge-sharing sessions and pair programming to ramp up quickly.
- **No prior experience working with these team members:** Establish clear communication channels and regular check-ins to ensure alignment and progress.
- **Lack of some needed resources:** Identify resource needs early and work with our instructor to secure access. Also, consider alternative tools that can serve the same purpose.

## Development Method
- **Methodology:** Scrum
  - **Sprints:** 1-week sprints
  - **Sprint Planning:** At the beginning of each sprint, we will plan our tasks and set our goals.
  - **Sprint Review and Retrospective:** At the end of each sprint, we will review our work, demonstrate completed features, and reflect on what went well and what could be improved.
