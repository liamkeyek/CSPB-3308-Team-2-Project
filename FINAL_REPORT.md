## What We Completed

### Liam
For this project, I took on the task of creating the calendar page, which ultimately became our home page. I implemented a functional monthly calendar view using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The page features a clean, responsive design with a modern color scheme, emphasizing usability and aesthetics. I developed navigation controls that allow users to move between months, handling year rollovers correctly. The calendar highlights the current day and displays reminders for specific dates, although currently, these reminders are hardcoded. I also added a header with navigation links to other parts of the application, setting up the structure for future development.

## What We Were in the Middle of Implementing

### Liam
I didn't implement the login page and unique user creation because it turned out to be way more complex than I initially thought. When we started the project, I didn't realize how much work goes into user authentication and security. It's not just about making a page where people type in a username and password; there's a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes to keep user data safe and make sure the right person is logging in. Plus, we would have needed to set up a proper database to store user information securely, which is a big task on its own. We were also running short on time, and since the calendar was our main focus, we decided to prioritize that instead.

## What We Had Planned for the Future

### Liam
In the future, if I wanted to add login functionality, I'd start by learning more about user authentication in Flask. I'd probably use Flask-Login, which is a library that helps manage user sessions. For the database, I'd look into using SQLAlchemy with Flask to handle user data. I'd also need to learn about password hashing to store passwords safely. To create the actual login page, I'd use HTML forms and some JavaScript for client-side validation. It would take some time to figure all this out, but it would be a cool addition to our project. I'd also make sure to include features like password reset and new account creation to make it more user-friendly.
